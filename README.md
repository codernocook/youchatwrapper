# youchatwrapper
IMPORTANT: This npm package is unoffical.
I found this api in You-Python github

You-Python Github: https://github.com/You-OpenSource/You-Python

It may have bug, please report.

Simple code:

```Javascript
const youchatwrapper = require("@codernocook/youchatwrapper")

youchatwrapper.apiKey = "Get Api Key here: https://betterapi.net/about/" // You don't really need it, you can get it if you like

youchatwrapper.chat("Who are you?", function(callback) {
    console.log(callback); // replace this with your code
})
```

Note: I'm a new javascript developer. My code write really bad.
